# CS224 Final Project: Reading Comprehension
### Overview
- The goal of the project is to implement a neural network architecture for Reading Comprehension using the recently
published Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)
- SQuAD is comprised of around 100K question-answer pairs, along with a context paragraph which were extracted from a set of articles from Wikipedia.
- In the SQuAD task, answering a question is defined as predicting an answer span within a given
context paragraph.
